title: Lab 7, Murder in SQL City
author: Danny Morehouse
---

For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related data sets to solve a murder mystery!

# Part 1: GitHub Workflow

At the top of the document (in the YAML) there is an `author` line that says 
`"Your name here!"`. Change this to be your name and save your file either by
clicking on the blue floppy disk or with a shortcut (command / control + s). 

Be sure to [commit the files to your repo](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first#stage-and-commit). 

Let's get started!


# Part 2: Some Words of Advice

-   Set chunk options carefully.

-   Make sure you don't print out more output than you need.

-   Make sure you don't assign more objects than necessary---avoid "object junk"
in your environment.

-   Make your code readable and nicely formatted.

-   Think through your desired result **before** writing any code.

# Part 3: Finding the Killer

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database
skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different
pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins,
driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in **all** of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or
remove this! Take some time to look at each file type so that 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcanner/stat_210_2025_website/main/labs/instructions/lab-7-setup.R")
```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!


**Step 1: Find the police report in `crime_scene_report`. Then used the information in the report to move on to the next data source based on the information learned.**

```{r}
# Code for looking at the relevant crime scene report.

crime_scene_report |> 
  filter(date == "20180115" & type == "murder" & city == "SQL City") |>
  pull(description)

```


**Next Steps: Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
There are accomplices, some knowingly and some unknowingly, but there is only one mastermind.


Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your
document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the
tables manually. Functions from `stringr` and `lubridate` will also be useful.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.
